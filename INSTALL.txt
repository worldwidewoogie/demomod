The following setup instructions are for Linux, and assume you are installing
into the directory /home/user/src/minecraft.  Similar instructions should work
for OSX.  I don't use Windows, so I don't have good instructions for that.

These instructions also assume you already have a working eclipse installation,
and that you have downloaded the latest forge source from:

http://files.minecraftforge.net/minecraftforge/1.8


First setup the directory and clone the repository:

mkdir -p ~/src/minecraft
cd ~/src/minecraft
git clone git@github.com:worldwidewoogie/demomod.git


Next, install the forge source:

cd demomod
unzip ~/Downloads/forge-1.8-11.14.3.1502-src.zip

When prompted to replace any file, hit 'N'

replace src/main/resources/mcmod.info? [y]es, [n]o, [A]ll, [N]one, [r]ename: N


Complete the forge setup process:

./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
./gradlew eclipse


Remove example mod:

rm -rf src/main/java/com


Test it out:

start eclipse
open workspace /home/user/src/minecraft/demomod/eclipse


You should be able to edit the Java project.
